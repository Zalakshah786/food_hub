## UX Design Process:
- **Link to User Stories in GitHub Projects:**
- I have used the MoSCoW technique to prioritize and complete my project requirements effectively. This technique helped me to categorize the features into Must-Have, Should-Have, and Could-Have, ensuring that the most critical functionalities were implemented first, while also considering additional enhancements for future development.

# Deployment:
## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy Django Project on Heroku

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your Django project on Heroku. Follow these steps carefully to get your project live.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- A Heroku account: [Create a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/)
- Installed [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Python 3.x and Django installed on your local machine
- Git installed on your local machine

### Step 1: Prepare Your Django Project

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Django project:
   - `gunicorn` for serving the application
   - `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL database support (or any database you're using)

   Install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn psycopg2

2.**Create a requirements.txt file**
   Run the following command to generate the requirements.txt file which lists all 
   
** dependencies:**
  ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```

3.**Create a Procfile**
    In the root directory of your project, create a Procfile to tell Heroku how to run the         application. 
    The content of this file should be:
    
  ```web: gunicorn <your_project_name>.wsgi```
  
Replace <your_project_name> with the actual name of your Django project.

4.Setup Database Configuration (Optional)

If you are using PostgreSQL or another database, make sure your project is configured to work with it. For PostgreSQL, update the DATABASES setting in 

settings.py:

```DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME'),
        'USER': os.environ.get('DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': os.environ.get('DB_HOST'),
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}```

### Step 2: Set Up Heroku

1. Log in to Heroku CLI
     Open your terminal and run the following command:

```heroku login```

2. Create a Heroku App
      Run the following command to create a new app on Heroku:

   ```heroku create <your-app-name>```
3. Set Environment Variables

Set the required environment variables for your project, such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, and ALLOWED_HOSTS:

```heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key> DEBUG=False ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com```

### Step 3: Deploy the Project

1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already initialized)
     If your project is not already a git repository, run:

```git init```


2.Commit Your Changes
   Add all the files to Git and commit them:
```git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"```

3.Push to Heroku
 Push your project to Heroku:

```git push heroku master ```

4.Migrate Database
  Once the project is deployed, run database migrations:

```heroku run python manage.py migrate```

5.Open Your App
    Finally, open your app in the browser:

```heroku open```
