- Elements such as images, text, and buttons resize and reposition appropriately for smaller screens.
  
✅ Navigation Adaptation
- A dynamic navbar automatically collapses into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- The navigation bar is sticky to improve accessibility and user experience.

  
✅ Scalable Images & Fonts
- High-quality responsive images and SVG icons are used to prevent distortion on different screen sizes.
- Font sizes adjust dynamically using relative units (em, rem, %) for better readability.

  
✅ Touch-Friendly Interactions
- Buttons, links, and interactive elements are optimized for touchscreens with adequate spacing.
- Hover effects gracefully transition into tap-friendly actions on mobile.

  
✅ Parallax & Effects Optimization
- The Parallax effect on the landing page is optimized for desktops but gracefully deactivates on mobile to ensure smooth scrolling.
- Animations and overlays scale efficiently to avoid performance issues on low-end devices.

  
✅ Testing & Cross-Browser Compatibility
- The website has been tested across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to ensure consistent performance.
- Developer tools and mobile emulators were used to verify responsiveness.

## UX Design Process:
- **Link to User Stories in GitHub Projects:**
- I have used the MoSCoW technique to prioritize and complete my project requirements effectively. This technique helped me to categorize the features into Must-Have, Should-Have, and Could-Have, ensuring that the most critical functionalities were implemented first, while also considering additional enhancements for future development.

# Deployment:
## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy Django Project on Heroku

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your Django project on Heroku. Follow these steps carefully to get your project live.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- A Heroku account: [Create a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/)
- Installed [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Python 3.x and Django installed on your local machine
- Git installed on your local machine

### Step 1: Prepare Your Django Project

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Django project:
   - `gunicorn` for serving the application
   - `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL database support (or any database you're using)

        Install them using pip:
          `pip install gunicorn psycopg2`

2.**Create a requirements.txt file**
         Run the following command to generate the requirements.txt file which lists all 
   
         dependencies:
         `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
3.**Create a Procfile**
        In the root directory of your project, create a Procfile to tell Heroku how to run the application. 
        The content of this file should be:
    
          ```web: gunicorn <your_project_name>.wsgi```

4.**Setup Database Configuration (Optional)**
         If you are using PostgreSQL or another database, make sure your project is configured to work with it. For PostgreSQL, update the DATABASES setting in 
           settings.py:

        ```DATABASES = {
                  'default': {
                  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                  'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME'),
                  'USER': os.environ.get('DB_USER'),
                  'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD'),
                  'HOST': os.environ.get('DB_HOST'),
                  'PORT': '5432',
                          }
                    }``
### Step 2: Set Up Heroku

1. Log in to Heroku CLI
     Open your terminal and run the following command:

          ```heroku login```

2. Create a Heroku App
      Run the following command to create a new app on Heroku:

         ```heroku create <your-app-name>```
3. Set Environment Variables

          Set the required environment variables for your project, such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, and ALLOWED_HOSTS:

          ```heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key> DEBUG=False ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com```



### Step 3: Deploy the Project

 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already initialized)
           If your project is not already a git repository, run:

                ```git init```


 2.Commit Your Changes
           Add all the files to Git and commit them:
              ```git add .
                 git commit -m "Initial commit"```

3.Push to Heroku
          Push your project to Heroku:

              ```git push heroku master ```
4.Migrate Database
          Once the project is deployed, run database migrations:

            ```heroku run python manage.py migrate```

5.Open Your App
          Finally, open your app in the browser:

            ```heroku open```
