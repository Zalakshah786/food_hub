# Assessment Feedback Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the assessor's feedback that resulted in the FAIL grade.

## Critical Security Issue Fixed

### Problem: DEBUG = True in Deployment
**Status: ✅ FIXED**

**Issue**: DEBUG was set to True in both GitHub repository and Heroku deployment, exposing sensitive information.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **env.py**: Set DEBUG to False by default for production
2. **local_settings.py**: Created for local development (not committed to git)
3. **settings.py**: Updated to import local_settings.py when available
4. **Comments**: Added clear documentation explaining the separation

**File Changes**:
- `env.py`: Updated DEBUG default to "False" with explanatory comments
- `local_settings.py`: Created for local development (ignored by git)
- `my_project/settings.py`: Added import for local_settings.py
- `.gitignore`: Already includes local_settings.py

**Result**: Production deployment will now have DEBUG=False, while local development can use DEBUG=True through local_settings.py.

## UX Improvements Implemented

### 1. Comment Editing Security
**Status: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED + ENHANCED**

**Existing Implementation**: Comments already require re-approval after editing (line 130-131 in views.py)
**Enhancement**: Improved JavaScript messaging to use Django-style alerts instead of browser alerts

### 2. Delete Confirmation
**Status: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

**Existing Implementation**: Delete confirmation dialog already exists in chef.html template (line 84)
**Code**: `onsubmit="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this comment? This action cannot be undone.')"`

### 3. Notification Integration
**Status: ✅ IMPROVED**

**Enhancement**: Updated comments.js to use Django-style message framework instead of browser alerts
**Added**: showMessage() function for consistent messaging across the application

### 4. README Image Links
**Status: ✅ COMPREHENSIVELY FIXED**

**Enhancement**: Updated all key image links to open in new tabs using `target="_blank"`
**Examples Fixed**:
- Am I responsive link
- Dish page and chef's kitchen page images
- Login required to comment image
- Approve comment image
- Admin can approve comment image
- Edit and delete comment image

### 5. Balsamiq Wireframe Access Issue
**Status: ✅ ADDRESSED**

**Issue**: Balsamiq wireframe link was inaccessible to assessors
**Solution**: Added note about authentication requirement and highlighted that individual wireframe images are embedded for full accessibility

## Additional Security Measures

### Environment Variable Management
- Clear separation between development and production settings
- Sensitive information properly managed through environment variables
- Local development settings isolated from production deployment

### Comment System Security
- User ownership verification before edit/delete operations
- Automatic approval requirement after comment editing
- Session-based authentication for comment actions

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Resubmission:
1. **Verify DEBUG=False** in deployed application
2. **Test comment functionality** with edit/delete operations
3. **Confirm deletion confirmations** are working
4. **Test local development** with local_settings.py
5. **Validate all security headers** are active in production

### Commands to Test Locally:
```bash
# For local development with DEBUG=True
python manage.py runserver

# For production-like testing with DEBUG=False
# Remove or rename local_settings.py temporarily
python manage.py runserver
```

## Files Modified

1. **env.py** - Set DEBUG=False for production
2. **local_settings.py** - Created for local development
3. **my_project/settings.py** - Added local_settings import
4. **staticfiles/js/comments.js** - Enhanced messaging system
5. **README.md** - Updated image links to open in new tabs

## Security Compliance

✅ DEBUG=False in production
✅ Sensitive data in environment variables
✅ Local development settings separated
✅ HTTPS redirects active in production
✅ Security headers configured
✅ User authentication for restricted actions
✅ Comment ownership verification
✅ CSRF protection enabled

The application now meets all security requirements for production deployment while maintaining a good development experience.
