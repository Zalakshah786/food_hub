# Resubmission Summary - Assessment Fixes

## 🔧 CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### ✅ **LO6.3 - DEBUG=False in Production (CRITICAL FIX)**
**Issue**: DEBUG was set to True in deployment, exposing sensitive information
**Solution**: 
- Modified `env.py` to set DEBUG=False by default
- Created `local_settings.py` for local development only
- Production deployment now automatically has DEBUG=False
- All security headers activated in production

### ✅ **Security & Environment Variables**
**Issue**: Potential exposure of sensitive data
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive files from being committed
- Created security audit tools to prevent future issues
- All credentials properly managed through environment variables
- No sensitive data in source code

### ✅ **UX Improvements**
**Issue**: Comment system needed better confirmation and messaging
**Solution**:
- Enhanced delete confirmation with detailed warning message
- Improved JavaScript messaging using Django message framework
- Comment editing requires re-approval (security feature)
- Better user feedback throughout the application

### ✅ **Documentation & Accessibility**
**Issue**: README images and wireframe link accessibility
**Solution**:
- Updated image links to open in new tabs
- Added note about wireframe accessibility
- Created comprehensive documentation for assessors
